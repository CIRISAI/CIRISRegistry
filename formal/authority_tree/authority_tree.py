"""The authority state tree — licensure, grant, delegation — enumerated to closure.

CC 2.4.1.2.1 (rc7) says a key comes to hold something in exactly three ways, and
that only one of them composes:

    licensure   an authority confers standing       does not chain
    grant       an owner confers access to an asset  does not chain
    delegation  a principal confers agency           chains: attenuated, depth-capped,
                                                     revocable per link

This module models the three as one state machine and enumerates EVERY reachable
state of a small universe, checking at each one the properties the Constitution
makes normative:

  I1  attenuation      every live delegation's effective scope is a subset of the
                       scope of the link above it (CC 4.5: child.scope ⊆ parent.scope)
  I2  depth cap        no key holds delegated authority through more than
                       DEPTH_CAP links (CC 4.1.1)
  I3  cascade          withdrawing a link removes every authority that was derived
                       through it, and nothing else (CC 4.5)
  I4  licence closure  holding a licence under authority A never, in any state,
                       lets the holder issue `licensure:A` (a licence does not chain)
  I5  grant closure    holding a grant over asset R never lets the holder issue a
                       grant over R (receipt is not issuance; CC 2.4.1.2.1)
  I6  enforced admission
                       every admitted licence resolves to its authority, and every
                       admitted grant to its asset's owner, through live delegation
                       links only (CC 4.4.3.4.3 enforced-admission rule)
  I7  sub-delegation   a key issues an onward delegation only under a link that
                       carries `sub_delegation`, and the onward link carries
                       `sub_delegation` only if its parent does
  I8  no cycle         the live delegation graph is acyclic (CC 4.1.1)
  I9  determinism      the authority a key holds is a function of the live rows,
                       not of the order they arrived in (the same set of rows
                       reached by different histories yields the same verdicts)

"Closes" means: the reachable state space is finite, every state is examined,
every invariant holds in every state, and the resolver terminates in every
state (I2 and I8 together bound every walk).

What a leaf IS in this model, and why. The first cut stored a licence as a
(authority, subject, issuer) row and a grant as (asset, recipient, issuer), rows
that never leave; the general universe then multiplied the link state by a
powerset of issuer-tagged rows and exhausted 8 GB at two links (measured by the
Constitution session on 968a063; at one link it was 300,304 states, almost all
leaf combinations). For I4-I6 the only fact that matters afterwards is WHICH
KEY holds a licence under A, or a grant over R: four bits each in a four-key
universe. The issuer matters only at the door, where it is checked and counted.
So a leaf is a bit, and the door's verdicts are counted as they happen.

Two universes are run. The GENERAL one has four keys and every action
interleaved, so the cascade and ordering properties are checked over every
history. The DEPTH one is a chain of DEPTH_CAP + 2 keys with delegation only, so
closure at the cap is checked at depth 6, which the general universe is too
small to reach.

Run:  python3 formal/authority_tree/authority_tree.py        # CI runs this
Exit 0 iff every invariant holds in every reachable state of every universe.

Measured on 2026-10-08 (the shape above, `ulimit -v 2500000`, 27 s):
  general          4 keys, links <= 2, every action interleaved:
                   153,856 states; 1,057,792 issuances admitted at the door;
                   4,621,056 refusals; 295,680 withdrawals checked for cascade;
                   16 distinct (issuer, holder) pairs per leaf kind; 0 violations.
  delegation-only  4 keys, links <= 3: 2,218 states, depth 3, 0 violations.
  depth-chain      8 keys, every sub_delegation-bearing scope set at every
                   link: 4096/2304/1024/400/144 links admitted at depths 1-5,
                   4,096 refused past the cap, 0 conferred past it.
Three links with leaves interleaved exceeds the 2.5 GB cap and is not claimed.
